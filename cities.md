### Meetups in other cities

Listed below is a collection of bitcoin-friendly meetups which host technically focused, discussion driven events. While each city will have its own style, some of the events they host follow the format of the "Socratic Seminars" described [here](https://bitdevs.org/about). Because these meetups may have many different event types, please make sure to read the event’s description before attending. If available, a link to the cities’ content aggregation archive is included.
